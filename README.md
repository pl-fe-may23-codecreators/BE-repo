# Nice Gadgets - Frontend Project

This is the backend side of the Nice Gadgets project, created by us - CodeCreators. This allows for [the frontend side](https://github.com/pl-fe-may23-codecreators/product-catalog) to connect and fetch data from external database and display products in their respective categories. The backend is built using Express.js and Sequelize ORM to provide said database communication.

## Technologies
